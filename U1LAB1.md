# My Fan Page - Part 1

### Teacher Notes

_Students pick up HTML element tags and nesting best through practice. This mini-lab is designed to have them explore these ideas through a lense they feel most comfortable with._

_Be careful sharing [documentation](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/) for this lesson. The list of HTML Elements are cumbersome and can be overwhelming for students. Instead, consider showing students the few elements you'd like them to practice using, and have them look up examples if need be._

### Prompt

Who's your favorite TV character, celebrity, historical figure, or role model? Imagine you were hired to make a fan page website for them. What would you include: a brief bio, a bunch of photos, links to other sites where you can see more of them?

**Directions**: Your task is to build a website or fan page with enough content to convince anyone that this person is worth knowing about. 

Include the following sections each wrapped in a `div` with an appropriate ID name:

- "Intro" or "Header" section with:
    - The person's name
    - catch phrase or quote
    - A picture
- "About Me" section
    - that describes what they're known for.
- An "Achievements", "Last Seen", or similar section.
    - This should include at least 3 nested `div`'s that each contain a title, picture, and an optional description for context.
    - This could be movie appearances, popular events, achievements or awards, or fictional locations that they've made an appearance at.
- An "Other" section
    - This should include other websites you can go to to find their work or impact on the world.

**Requirements**:

Include the following html elements in your code...

1. An html skeleton (html, head, body)
2. At least two header elements(h1, h3, etc)
3. At least one paragraph element
4. At least one image element
5. At least one anchor element linking to another page
6. All the elements above are nested inside the body
7. Encapsulate sections in a `div`
8. Stretch: Display something (like the other websites) as a list.

### Exemplar

Take a look at this [finished example](./U1LAB1-Exemplar/index.html) before you start to get an idea of what your fan page might look like.

### Culturally Responsive Best Practice

Students have the opportunity to personalize this lab by selecting nonfictional or fictional celebrities of their choosing. Feel free to, but be cautious when adding restriction to students' choice here.

### Extra Help?

How do I make a link? How do I import a picture? I forgot the syntax! Check out [this documentation](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_byfunc.asp) on w3schools use CTRL F (CMD F on a mac) to find what you're looking for.

Finished with your HTML and want to browse through more specific colors? Check out this [Color Picker](https://www.google.com/search?q=color+picker&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS1002US1002&oq=color+picker&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0i131i433i512l2j0i433i512j0i131i433i512j69i60j69i61j69i60.1520j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) or search "Color Picker" on Google and select an exact color. Check out [this CSS example](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_text_background) on how to apply it on w3schools.

### Extensions

**Mild**:
- Add an extra section on the page that includes a title and a short description. One idea is to add a "Gallery" section with more photos of the person you chose.

**Medium**
- Use a table to organize the "Achievements" section. The table should have a title, date, picture, and description as headings. Check out this resource on [HTML tables](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp) if you need it.

**Spicy**
- You may have noticed that some of your page is already styled with colors. Peak into the `style.css`, change the values, and notice what changes on your website. Add IDs and class names where appropriate and see if you can fiddle with the properties on your page like color and image width. Use the example lab and [this resource on IDs and styling](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_id.asp) to help you.

**Reflection Questions:**

- What are some things you would do to make this website prettier if you could and had more time? You may want to look online for some inspiration.
